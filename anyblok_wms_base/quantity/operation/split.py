    """A split of PhysObj record in two.

    Splits replace their input's :class:`PhysObj
    <anyblok_wms_base.quantity.physobj.PhysObj>` record with
    two of them, one having the wished :attr:`quantity`, along with
    Avatars at the same location, while
    keeping the same properties and the same total quantity.

    This is therefore destructive for the input's PhysObj, which is not
    conceptually satisfactory, but will be good enough at this stage of
    development.

    While non trivial in the database, they may have no physical counterpart in
    the real world. We call them *formal* in that case.

    Formal Splits are operations of a special kind, that have to be considered
    internal details of ``wms-core``, that are not guaranteed to exist in the
    future.

    Formal Splits can always be reverted with
    :class:`Aggregate <.aggregate.Aggregate>` Operations,
    but only some physical Splits can be reverted, depending on
    the PhysObj Type.

    .. seealso:: :class:`Model.Wms.PhysObj.Type
                 <anyblok_wms_base.quantity.physobj.Type>`
                 for a full discussion including use-cases of formal and
                 physical splits and reversal of the latter.

    In the formal case, we've decided to represent this as an Operation for
    the sake of consistency, and especially to avoid too much special cases
    in implementation of various concrete Operations.

    The benefit is that Splits appear explicitely in the history, and this
    helps implementing :ref:`history manipulating methods
    <op_cancel_revert_obliviate>` a lot.

    The drawback is that we get a proliferation of PhysObj records, some of
    them even with a zero second lifespan, but even those could be simplified
    only for executed Splits.

    Splits are typically created and executed from :class:`Splitter Operations
    <.splitter.WmsSplitterOperation>`, and that explains the
    above-mentioned zero lifespans.
