              },
          }

        .. note:: Non standard parameters can be specified, for use in
                  :meth:`Specific hooks <specific_outcome_properties>`.

        **Inputs**

        The ``inputs`` part of the specification is primarily a list of
        expected inputs, with various criteria (Goods Type, quantity,
        Goods code and Properties).

        Besides requiring them in the first place, these criteria are also
        used to :meth:`qualify (match) the inputs <match_inputs>`
        (note that Operation inputs are unordered in general,
        while this ``inputs`` parameter is). This spares the
        calling code the need to keep track of that qualification after
        selecting the goods in the first place. The result of that
        matching is stored in the :attr:`match` field, is kept for later
        Assembly state changes and can be used by application
        code, e.g., for operator display purposes.

        Assemblies can also have extra inputs,
        according to the value of the ``allow_extra_inputs`` boolean
        parameter. This is especially useful for generic packing scenarios.

        Having both specified and extra inputs is supported (imagine packing
        client parcels with specified wrapping, a greetings card plus variable
        contents).

        The ``type`` criterion applies the Goods Type hierarchy, hence it's
        possible to create a generic packing Assembly for a whole family of
        Goods Types (e.g., adult trekking shoes).

        Similarly, all Property requirements take the properties inherited
        from the Goods Types into account.

        **Global Property specifications**

        The Assembly :attr:`specification` can have the following
        key/value pairs:

        * ``outcome_properties``:
             a dict whose keys are Assembly states, and values are
             dicts of Properties to set on the outcome; the values
             are pairs ``(TYPE, EXPRESSION)``, evaluated by passing as
             positional arguments to :meth:`eval_typed_expr`.
        * ``inputs_properties``:
             a dict whose keys are Assembly states, and values are themselves
             dicts with key/values:

             + required:
                 list of properties that must be present on all inputs
                 while reaching or passing through the given Assembly state,
                 whatever their values
             + required_values:
                 dict of Property key/value pairs that all inputs must bear
                 while reaching or passing through the given Assembly state.
             + forward:
                 list of properties to forward to the outcome while
                 reaching or passing through the given Assembly state.

        **Per input Property checking, matching and forwarding**

        The same parameters as in ``inputs_properties`` can also be specified
        inside each :class:`dict` that form
        the ``inputs`` list of the :meth:`Assembly specification <spec>`),
        as the ``properties`` sub parameter.

        In that case, the Property requirements are used either as
        matching criteria on the inputs, or as a check on already matched
        Goods, according to the value of the ``inputs_spec_type`` parameter
        (default is ``'match'`` in the ``planned`` Assembly state,
        and ``'check'`` in the other states).

        Example::

          'inputs_spec_type': {
              'started': 'match',  # default is 'check' for
                                   # 'started' and 'done' states
          },
          'inputs': [
              {'type': 'GT1',
               'quantity': 1,
               'properties': {
                   'planned': {'required': ['x']},
                   'started': {
                       'required_values': {'x': True},
                   },
                   'done': {
                       'forward': ['foo', 'bar'],
                   },
              …
          ]

        During matching, per input specifications are applied in order,
        but remember that
        the ordering of ``self.inputs`` itself is to be considered random.

        In case ``inputs_spec_type`` is ``'check'``, the checking is done
        on the Goods matched by previous states, thus avoiding a potentially
        costly rematching. In the above example, matching will be performed
        in the ``'planned'`` and ``'started'`` states, but a simple check
        will be done if going from the ``started`` to the ``done`` state.

        It is therefore possible to plan an Assembly with partial information
        about its inputs (waiting for some Observation, or a previous Assembly
        to be done), and to
        refine that information, which can be displayed to operators, or have
        consequences on the Properties of the outcome, at each state change.
        In many cases, rematching the inputs for all state changes is
        unnecessary. That's why, to avoid paying the computational cost
        three times, the default value is ``'check'`` for the ``done`` and
        ``started`` states.

        The result of matching is stored in the :attr:`match` field.

        In all cases, if a given Property is to be forwarded from several
        inputs to the outcome and its values on these inputs aren't equal,
        :class:`AssemblyPropertyConflict` will be raised.

        **Passing through states**

        Following the general expectations about states of Operations, if
        an Assembly is created directly in the ``done`` state, it will apply
        the ``outcome_properties`` for the ``planned``, ``started`` and
        ``done`` states.
        Also, the matching and checks of input Properties for the ``planned``,
        ``started`` and ``done`` state will be performed, in that order.

        In other words, it behaves exactly as if it had been first planned,
        then started, and finally executed.

        Similarly, if a planned Assembly is executed (without being started
        first), then outcome Properties, matches and checks related to the
        ``started`` state are performed before those of the ``done`` state.

        **for_contents: building the contents Property**

        The outcome of the Assembly bears the special :data:`contents property
        <anyblok_wms_base.constants.CONTENTS_PROPERTY>`, also
        used by :class:`Operation.Unpack
        <anyblok_wms_base.core.operation.unpack.Unpack>`.

        This makes the reversal of Assemblies by Unpacks possible (with
        care in the behaviour specifications), and also can be used by
        applicative code to use information about the inputs even after the
        Assembly is done.

        The building of the contents Property is controlled by the
        ``for_contents`` parameter, which itself is either ``None`` or a
        pair of strings, whose first element indicates which inputs to list,
        and the second how to list them.

        The default value of ``for_contents`` is :attr:`DEFAULT_FOR_CONTENTS`.

        If ``for_contents`` is ``None``, no contents Property will be set
        on the outcome. Use this if it's unnecessary pollution, for instance
        if it is custom set by specific hooks anyway, or if no Unpack for
        disassembly is ever to be wished.

        *for_contents: possible values of first element:*

        * ``'all'``:
             all inputs will be listed
        * ``'extra'``:
            only the actual inputs that aren't specified in the
            behaviour will be listed. This is useful in cases where
            the Unpack behaviour already takes the specified ones into
            account. Hence, the variable parts of Assembly and Unpack are
            consistent.

        *for_contents: possible values of second element:*

        * ``'descriptions'``:
            include Goods' Types, those Properties that aren't recoverable by
            an Unpack from the Assembly outcome, together with appropriate
            ``forward_properties`` for those who are (TODO except those that
            come from a global ``forward`` in the Assembly specification)
        * ``'records'``:
            same as ``descriptions``, but also includes the record ids, so
            that an Unpack following the Assembly would not give rise to new
            Goods records, but would reuse the existing ones, hence keep the
            promise that the Goods records are meant to track the "sameness"
            of the physical objects.

        **Merging logic**

        All sub parameters are merged according to the expected type. For
        instance, ``required`` and ``forward`` in the various Property
        parameters are merged as a :class:`set`.

        As displayed in the example above, if there's an ``inputs`` part
        in :attr:`parameters`, it must be made of exactly the same number
        of ``dicts`` as within the :attr:`outcome_type` behaviour. More
        precisely, these lists are merged using the :func:`zip` Python
        builtin, which results in a truncation to the shortest. Of course,
        not having an ``inputs`` part in :attr:`parameters` does *not*
        result in empty ``inputs``.

        .. seealso:: :attr:`SPEC_LIST_MERGE` and
                     :func:`dict_merge <anyblok_wms_base.utils.dict_merge>`.

        **Specific hooks**

        While already powerful, the Property manipulations described above
        are not expected to fit all situations. This is obviously true for
        the rule forbidding the forwarding of values that aren't equal for
        all relevant inputs: in some use cases, one would want to take the
        minimum of theses values, sum them, keep them as a list,
        or all of these at once… On the other hand, the specification is
        already complicated enough as it is.

        Therefore, the core will stick to these still
        relatively simple primitives, but will also provide the means
        to perform custom logic, through :meth:`assembly-specific hooks
        <specific_outcome_properties>`
