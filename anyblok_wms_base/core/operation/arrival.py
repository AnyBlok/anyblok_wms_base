    In case the Arrival state is ``planned``,

    on the application:

    - maybe the application won't use the ``planned`` state at all, and
      will only create Arrival after checking them,
    - maybe the application will inspect the Arrival properties, compare them
      to reality, update them on the created PhysObj and cancel downstream
      operations if needed, before calling :meth:`execute`.
