"""Various constants used throughout WMS applications.

Enumeration of Selection columns
--------------------------------

This module defines several constants for use in Selection columns
definitions. In this fundational library, we actually don't care about the
labels, since we have no specified user interaction.

However, the Selection column type forces us to define some, that's why we
settled for labels than can themselves be used stably and without ambiguity
as keys for a display system (with i18n in mind), such as
``wms_op_type_pack``.
