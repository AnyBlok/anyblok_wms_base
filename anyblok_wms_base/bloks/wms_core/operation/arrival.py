    """Operation to describe physical arrival of goods in some location.

    Arrivals store data about the expected or arrived Goods: properties, code,
    quantityâ€¦ These are copied over to the corresponding Goods records in all
    cases and stay inert after the fact.

    In case the Arrival state is ``planned``,
    these are obviously only unchecked values,
    but in case it is ``done``, the actual meaning can depend
    on the application:

    - maybe the application won't use the ``planned`` state at all, and
      will only create Arrival after checking them,
    - maybe the application will inspect the Arrival properties, compare them
      to reality, update them on the created Goods and cancel downstream
      operations if needed, before calling :meth:`execute`.

    TODO maybe provide higher level facilities for validation scenarios.
