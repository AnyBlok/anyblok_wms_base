    the ultimate representation of the Goods "staying the same" or "becoming
    different" under the Operations, which is, ultimately, a subjective
    decision that has to be left to downstream libraires and applications, or
    even end users.

    For instance, everybody agrees that moving something around does not make
    it different. Therefore, the Move Operation uses the same Goods record
    in its outcome as in its input.
    On the other hand, changing a property could be considered enough an
    alteration of the physical object to consider it different, or not (think
    of recording some measurement that had not be done earlier.)

    Depending on the Goods Type, this represents in reality some physical
    measure (length of wire, weight of wheat) for Goods stored and handled
    in bulk, or a number of identical items, if goods are kept as individual
    pieces.

    There is no corresponding idea of a unit of measure for bulk Goods,
    as we believe it to be enough to represent it in the Goods Type already
    (which would be, e.g, respectively a meter of wire, a ton of wheat). Note
    that bulk Goods can be the result of some :class:`Unpack
    <.operation.Unpack>`, with the packaged version
    being itself handled as an individual piece (imagine spindles of 100m for
    the wire example) and further packable (pallets, containersâ€¦)

    applications. However, for performance reasons, applications are
    free to overload this column with other numeric types (i.e.,
    supporting transparently all the usual operations with the same
    syntax, both in Python and SQL).

    Examples :

    + applications not caring about fractional quantities
      might want to overload this column with an Integer column for
      extra performance (if that really makes a difference).

    + applications having to deal with fractional quantities not well
      behaved in decimal notation (e.g., thirds of cherry pies)
      may want to switch to a rational number type, such as ``mpq``
      type on the PostgreSQL side), although it's probably a better idea
      if there's an obvious common denominator to just use integers
      (following on the example, simply have Goods Types representing
      those thirds of pies alongside those representing the whole pies,
      and represent the first cutting of a slice as an

    Properties can be shared among several Goods records, for efficiency.

    Goods records.

    taken not to conflict with the keys used by ``wms-core`` and other bloks

    (represent something happening in reality), and if that's the case if they

    We don't want to impose reversibility to be equal for both directions,
    as we don't feel confident it would be true in all use cases (it is indeed
    in the ones presented below).

    Reality of Split and Aggregate and their reversibilitues can be queried

    :meth:`is_split_reversible` and :meth:`is_aggregate_reversible`

      quantities are integers, and there's no difference in reality
      between N>1 records of a given Goods Type with quantity=1 having
      identical properties and locations on one hand, and a
      record with quantity=N at the same location with the same properties, on
      the other hand.

      .. note:: This use case is so frequent that we are considering moving
                all notions of quantities together with Split and Aggregate
                Operations out of ``wms-core`` in a separate Blok.

                See :ref:`improvement_no_quantities` for more on this.

    * if the represented goods are meters of wiring, then Splits are physical,
      they mean cutting the wires, but Aggregates probably can't happen
      in reality, and therefore Splits are irreversible.
    * if the represented goods are kilograms of sand, kept in bulk,
      then Splits mean in reality shoveling some out of, while Aggregates mean
      shoveling some in (associated with Move operations, obviously).
