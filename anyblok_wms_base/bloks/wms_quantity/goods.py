    Depending on the Goods Type, this represents in reality some physical
    measure (length of wire, weight of wheat) for Goods stored and handled
    in bulk, or a number of identical items, if goods are kept as individual
    pieces.

    There is no corresponding idea of a unit of measure for bulk Goods,
    as we believe it to be enough to represent it in the Goods Type already
    (which would be, e.g, respectively a meter of wire, a ton of wheat). Note
    that bulk Goods can be the result of some :ref:`op_unpack`, with the
    packaged version
    being itself handled as an individual piece (imagine spindles of 100m for
    the wire example) and further packable (pallets, containersâ€¦)

    This field has been defined as Decimal to cover a broad scope of
    applications. However, for performance reasons, applications are
    free to overload this column with other numeric types (i.e.,
    supporting transparently all the usual operations with the same
    syntax, both in Python and SQL).

    Examples :

    + applications not caring about fractional quantities
      might want to overload this column with an Integer column for
      extra performance (if that really makes a difference).

    + applications having to deal with fractional quantities not well
      behaved in decimal notation (e.g., thirds of cherry pies)
      may want to switch to a rational number type, such as ``mpq``
      type on the PostgreSQL side), although it's probably a better idea
      if there's an obvious common denominator to just use integers
      (following on the example, simply have Goods Types representing
      those thirds of pies alongside those representing the whole pies,
      and represent the first cutting of a slice as an
      Unpack)

    As a special case, the behaviours specify whether
    :class:`Split <.operation.split.Split>` and
    :class:`Aggregate <.operation.aggregate.Aggregate>` Operations are physical
    (represent something happening in reality), and if that's the case if they
    are reversible, using ``{"reversible": true}``, defaulting to ``false``,
    in the ``split`` and ``aggregate`` behaviours, respectively.

    We don't want to impose reversibility to be equal for both directions,
    as we don't feel confident it would be true in all use cases (it is indeed
    in the ones presented below).

    Reality of Split and Aggregate and their reversibilitues can be queried
    using :meth:`are_split_aggregate_physical`,
    :meth:`is_split_reversible` and :meth:`is_aggregate_reversible`

    Use cases:

    * if the represented goods come as individual pieces in reality, then all
      quantities are integers, and there's no difference in reality
      between N>1 records of a given Goods Type with quantity=1 having
      identical properties and locations on one hand, and a
      record with quantity=N at the same location with the same properties, on
      the other hand.

    * if the represented goods are meters of wiring, then Splits are physical,
      they mean cutting the wires, but Aggregates probably can't happen
      in reality, and therefore Splits are irreversible.
    * if the represented goods are kilograms of sand, kept in bulk,
      then Splits mean in reality shoveling some out of, while Aggregates mean
      shoveling some in (associated with Move operations, obviously).
      Both operations are certainly reversible in reality.
