        This is safe with respect to concurrency: no other transaction
        can claim the same Request (guaranteed by a PostgreSQL lock).

        The session will forget about this Request as soon as one
        exits the ``with`` statement, and the underlying PG lock is

        elegant to tie it to the transaction, to get automatic
        release, without a ``with`` syntax, but that requires more
        digging into SQLAlchemy and Anyblok internals.

        TODO I think FOR UPDATE actually creates a new internal PG row
        (table bloat). Shall we switch to advisory locks (see PG doc) with an
        harcoded mapping to an integer ?
