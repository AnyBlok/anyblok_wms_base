AnyBlok / Wms Base documentation
================================

Anyblok / WMS Base is a core library to build Stock,
Logistics and Warehouse Management applications.

Anyblok / WMS Base is free software, released, as well as the present
documentation, under the terms of the :doc:`LICENSE`.

It is implemented in Python 3, and relies on the `Anyblok
<https://anyblok.readthedocs.io>`_ pluggable
ORM framework to provide flexibility to downstream libraries and
applications.

This project is in early development phase, and most of the
documentation is currently scattered in the codes' docstrings
(currently undergoing aggregation in thes pages you're browsing).

Please read :ref:`design_goals` and skim :ref:`core_concepts` to
get a grasp of what it intends to do.
