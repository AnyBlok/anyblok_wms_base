Removing Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These operations take some :ref:`Avatars <physobj_avatar>` as inputs,
and have no outcomes.

Of course, since Anyblok / Wms Base keeps the full history,
technically, the incoming Avatars are not removed from the database.
Rather, their :attr:`state
<anyblok_wms_base.core.physobj.main.state>` field
is being set to ``past`` during execution.
