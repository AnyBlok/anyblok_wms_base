Roadmap
=======

This is not a promise, rather an expression of intentâ€¦ This will get
updated along the way.

0.9
~~~
* (simple cases of) :ref:`improvement_operation_superseding`
* :ref:`improvement_inventory`
* First use in production ever (under our direct control)
* Data schema stability (meaning that changes come with appropriate
  migration tools)

1.0.0
~~~~~
* API stability: abiding to `Semantic versioning rules <https://semver.org/>`_
* Some performance tuning
