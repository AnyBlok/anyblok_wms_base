updated along the way.

* First release pushed on PyPI and advertised a bit
* Detangling of the :ref:`issues with quantities
  <improvement_no_quantities>` (new blok, new Python distribution or not)
* Decisions about Location and stock levels:
  :ref:`improvement_location_name` and :ref:`improvement_stock_levels`
* new Operations: Pack / Assembly (decision whether it's the same
  thing or not)
* work begins on :ref:`blok_wms_bus` and/or :ref:`blok_wms_rest_api`

0.8
