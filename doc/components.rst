Components
==========

Anyblok / Wms Base provides several components, what Anyblok calls
"Bloks". This means that you have to install them in the database,
update them etc.

.. _blok_wms_core:

wms-core
--------

As the name suggests, this Blok provides the :ref:`core_concepts` of
Anyblok / Wms.

wms-aggregated-goods

This is the outcome of a possible refactor, see
:ref:`improvement_no_quantities`.

wms-rest-api

.. _blok_wms_bus:
